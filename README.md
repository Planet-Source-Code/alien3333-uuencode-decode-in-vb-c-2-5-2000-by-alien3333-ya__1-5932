### Description

' UUencode/decode in VB (c) 2/5/2000 by Alien3333@yahoo.com

' A small utility that uuencode and decode with a easy standard M$ GUI

'

' Well, I put this together in my 2 day vacation to celebrate Chinese New Year !

' All codes are standard as possible, ignore some of my clumsy C-style codes =)

' This small application show how to use filelistbox, listbox, drivelistbox, dirlistbox,

' Reading/Writing binary files, Reading text file line by line, Reading file in small portions,

' uuencode/decode with VB way, not C way of bit shifting, character and string manipulation,

' and all you can name it ...

'

' I learn VB through the Internet and MSDN, so some of the codes can look very familiar.

' I also read through uuencode.c and uudecode.c in LINUX to verify correctness.

'

' Enjoy !!!

'

### More Info
 
' Very Important pad 3 byte to make 3 multiple

' This can add 1 or 2 extra NULL character to the end of the file

' Resulting a different file size, but no harm, for easier implementation
